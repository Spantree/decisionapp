A React component library implementing a Pugh Decision Matrix with event sourcing and a git-like repository layer.

## Architecture Decision Records

Before making architectural decisions (new patterns, dependencies, structural changes), read existing ADRs in `docs/adr/` to understand prior decisions and stay consistent with established patterns. The ADR index is at `docs/adr/index.md`.

After completing architecturally significant work, suggest documenting it with `/adr:create`.
